  "summary": "Completed Loop 004 HabitPulse QA placeholder coverage with additive, backward-compatible streak edge-case checks and contract field constraints; prior loop outputs remain accepted.

  "risks": [
    "Checklist and contract spec are documentation-level artifacts and are not yet backed by executable automated tests.",
    "Timezone and DST behavior is specified in QA notes but still depends on implementation consistency in downstream services."
