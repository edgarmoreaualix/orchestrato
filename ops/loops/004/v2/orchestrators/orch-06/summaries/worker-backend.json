  "summary": "Finalized Loop 004 StatusDock backend placeholder contract with additive optional incident/timeline metadata and stable required keys; documented final cadence and compatibility notes in README across loop stage 4.",
  "risks": [
    "Optional metadata enums (impact_scope, communication_channel) are placeholders and may need normalization once production API contracts are locked.",
    "Timeline actor/component semantics are descriptive only and could diverge from operational incident tooling taxonomy."
  ]
